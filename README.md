# Worm Movement Database
Movement Analysis on the cloud

This is intended to capture work toward an open cloud-based database framework for worm movement experimental data.

## Overview of Interface Workflow

A typical workflow for using this interface is expected to go a little something
like this:

![Landing Page](webworm_docs/screenshots/LandingPage.png)

1. Once on the landing page, the user visits the "Search Tool" tab to begin the process of making queries to the database by different criteria.

  ![Select Filters](webworm_docs/screenshots/Filter and Select Strains.png)

2. Apply Filters. There are two basic types of filters users can apply - "Select Features" allow users to select a subset of metadata with range values; and "Select Discrete Values" allow users to pick only the characteristics that matter. "Filter, Review, and Confirm" then lets the user set the range values to filter the database.

3. Review results, and select final set of experiments to download data in the "Results" tab.

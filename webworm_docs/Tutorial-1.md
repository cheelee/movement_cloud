# Movement Database Tutorial

## Use the Search Bar

The full database is loaded at the start. The **search bar** lets you
choose specific subsets of the database to load. 

**Type "N2" into the search bar**. You will see a list of matches with
different categories. Use the mouse to **scroll down** to the _Strains
category_ and **click on the row** "AQ2947 (CGC N2 (Bristol, UK))."

You will see that the tool has filled out the search line with the
appropriate details like below. **Click** on the "Search" button.

The database will now reload with only that strain's data. Notice how
the crossfilter charts have changed accordingly.

# Movement Database Tutorial

## Crossfilter Results

The **crossfilter** tool lets you dynamically refine the search by a
set of features means values. The "Experiment Date" and "Days of
Adulthood" charts are always available to crossfilter against. The
other features can be added or removed.

**Click on** the "Change Crossfilter Features Here" button. This takes
you to the tool that lets you change crossfilter feature sets. The
highlighted rows in the list of "Common Core Features" are currently
what is available for crossfilter.

**Click on** the "midbody_bend_mean_abs" row to deselect it. 
Now **click on** the "area" and "head_tip_speed_abs" rows to
select them. Notice how the table highlight changes.

**Click on** the "Apply New Configuration" button. The database
will now reload.

Now we want only the long worms 10 days and older. Use the mouse to
**drag along** the "length" chart so only the worms longer than 900
are selected.

Notice how the other charts react to this change. Also notice how the
"Dynamic Preview" table changes with your actions as well. **Repeat**
for the "Days of Adulthood" chart with worms 10 days and older. The
charts should now look like the following.
